			<p>In this work the artist used the technique of audio-sampling as her main tool to translate everyday motions of pedestrians into a musical composition. This piece is exploring the potential of the daily stroll as an intermediate practice that imports an elemental rhythmic flux into the more fixed structures of dialy routine. </p>

			<h2>All Adventures are Recalling the Past</h2>
			<p>This is an interactive installation using computer wallpapers and internet-found travel stories. The definition of the images on one screen changes gently yet continuously with the emergence of the marked keywords, such as “all”, “adventures”, “are”, “recalling”, “the” and “past”.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="rape info">
			<h2>Rape</h2>
			<p>The film project “Rape” repeats the plot of the experiental film with the same name made by Yoko Ono in the end of the 60s and is reflecting on the situation of being seen in our age of self-surveillance.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paradise info">
			<h2>As Beautiful as Paradise</h2>
			<span class="metainfo"></span>
			<p>This is a radioplay featured on FSK (Freies Sender Kombinat) Hamburg as well as at Cemetery Ohlsdorf. The story is adapted from a true accident in the Mount Everest area in 2015 which was reported differently by a broad spectrum of internet-based press.<br>The artist used the material which was recorded repeatedly with the same content and the same speaker to associate the different interpretations of the truth. Many ambient sounds in this piece come from the movie “L’Aventura”. Similar to the radio play, this movie is also about a missing woman. The ambient sounds work as citations to add another layer to this story.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="home info">
			<h2>Final Home</h2>
			<p>Final Home is a karaoke-video contributed to the collective project “Holiday” from Michaela Melián's artist class at HFBK. “Holiday” is an installation stage featuring videos, music pieces and performances, adapting the form and idea of a karaoke lounge in asian entertainment culture. Through artistic staging, the lounge has been transformed into a space where body interactions and culture reverberance take place.

			<h2>Drinking and Loitering</h2>
			<span class="metainfo">Sound</span>
			<p>This piece is a collective project in a discontinued health cure facility in Bad Tölz, Bavaria. With image, sound and performance, the contributing artists tried to unveil the history of this space and to question the notion of well-being in an up to date context.
				<br>Xinyi Li contributed an audio piece which was played at the entrance of an assembly hall.
				A computer program read the inscription on the floor about its construction, using phonetic rules of different languages. The sounds were recorded and sorted according to their differences to German. In the audio piece, a simple German sentence loses its meaning gradually and turns more abstract through each of the repetitions and ends up being a brief spell of rhythm and tonality.
